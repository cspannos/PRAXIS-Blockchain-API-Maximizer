# Importing OpenAPI documents

Swagger Editor can import your OpenAPI document, which can be formatted as JSON or YAML.

### File → Import File

Click **Choose File** and select import. The file you are importing has to be a valid JSON or YAML OpenAPI document. Swagger Editor will prompt you about validation errors, if any exist.

### File → Import URL

Paste the URL to your OpenAPI document. 

### Drag and Drop

Simply drag and drop your OpenAPI JSON or YAML document into the Swagger Editor browser window.
