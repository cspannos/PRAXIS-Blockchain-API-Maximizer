# PRAXIS Blockchain API Maximizer
PRAXIS is a strategic deployment suite enabling API analysis across nodes, networks, and method calls to leverage protocol performance and access new opportunities for mass adoption by standardizing the OpenAPI specification, one of the most widely used Web 2.0 API specifications. 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Web 2.0 API tooling and infrastructure is far more advanced than the Ethereum blockchain's JSON-RPC specification. This creates barriers to entry and to mass adoption since Developers and their applications have difficulty interfacing with the protocol.

## SOLUTION
PRAXIS API Maximizer solves this problem by providing a suite of tools for Developers to carry out API method analysis and network strategy so that Developers can build applications and tooling that are data driven, hardened for security, and optimized for performance, within the most commonly used API framework.
 

## Method Analysis Tool
Description & Installation | Model
------------ | -------------
Visualizing the relationships and volume of 65 Ethereum method calls -- covered by top Ethereum clients -- by name, group, and degree. <br><br> To run this tool:<br>  1. ```git clone https://github.com/cspannos/PRAXIS-Blockchain-API-Maximizer.git``` <br>  2. ```cd arc-method```<br> 3. start simple server: ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```  <br> The tool will run on port: 8000  | ![Method Arc](/img/arc.jpg)


## P2P Network Strategy
Description | Model
------------ | -------------
